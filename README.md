# VBA_challenge
Here the task was to write a script in VBA that would be able to sort through all the changes to each stock in the ticker throughout the given years.  We wanted the script to produce a value for the (color coded) yearly change, a percentage of how much each stock either rose or fell, and the total stock value.

Based on photos of what our results should look like, I believe my script works albeit with a few hiccups.  It needs to be run on each worksheet individually, and the color coding for some reason only applies once you run it a second time.  Hope to correct that later.
